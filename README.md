# visualization-challenge

* In this repository we take in data from two csv files (Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv) to create a merged DataFrame in Pandas for further analysis and visualization with Matplotlib.
* This data covers treatments of tumors in mice with different drug regimens. Our specific focus is on the performance of the drug Capomulin against its competitors.
* Extended analysis is included within the jupyter notebook, but in summary, we found that Capomulin and Ramicane performed signicantly better and more consistently in regards to tumor volume reduction in the treatment mice than their competitors.
